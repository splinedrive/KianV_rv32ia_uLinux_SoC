# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "8x2"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Hirosh Dabui"      # Your name
  title:        "KianV uLinux SoC"      # Project title
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "A RISC-V ASIC that can boot μLinux."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
    Here is an RV32IMA RISC-V processor that can boot and run uLinux.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
    You need to flash the bootloader, dtb, and the Linux image onto the NOR flash.
    It was tested on the ICE40 with the same design at 35MHz.
    There is a divider register located at 0x10_000_010.
    With the upper 16 bits, the CLINT can be configured, and with the lower 16 bits, the UART can be configured.
